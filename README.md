# git-good-practices
This is the repository of the Twitch channel @le_moment_it


## Github Desktop

- Successfully :
  - Create/delete a new branch (local and remote)
  - Commit
  - Create Tags / Delete Tags in local But cannot delete remote tags
  - Rebase -> No conflict resolver integrated, need to use VScode
  - Squash , no problem
  - Stash -> Only one stash possible at the moment


- Bad points : 
  - No branches schema (for the Linux version)
  - Create automatically profiles on git, can change the git config behavior
  - No official integration for Linux but we can find a good fork [shiftkey/desktop](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop)
